\section{update 2}

Recently, the first results of stress perfusion CT have
also been published. Many of these imaging methods have
been reported to yield a high negative predictive value, i.e.
a normal result of these tests rules out a haemodynamically
significant CAD with a high probability. For a reasonable
implication of imaging strategies in clinical practice,
however, the pre-test probability must be considered to
avoid needless examinations [1]. High pre-test probability
invariably demands invasive coronary angiography for
planning or performing revascularisation therapy. Intermediate
pre-test probability, on the contrary, justifies deferring
further imaging studies, if MRI and/or CT are/is normal.
Cardiac MRI has matured into a multipurpose noninvasive
imaging tool for the assessment of ischaemic
cardiomyopathy. The breadth of applications possible with
cardiac MRI allows combined non-invasive assessment of
myocardial perfusion, function and myocardial viability—a
task that usually requires use of myocardial scintigraphy
and echocardiography. As such, cardiac MRI currently
holds a strong position in the non-invasive work-up of
patients with CAD. The distinct advantages of MRI over
current conventional nuclear-based cardiac-imaging techniques,
such as PET or myocardial scintigraphy, include its
high spatial resolution and lack of exposure of the patient to
ionising radiation. Also, quantification of cardiac morphology
and function by MRI is more accurate and image
quality is more reproducible than in echocardiography,
independent of the operator’s experience and skill level or
the patient’s anatomy.

The review and outlook presented here will focus on
three major aspects of non-invasive MR and CT imaging in
the diagnosis of CAD. The first part describes the clinical
value of contrast-enhanced non-invasive CT coronary
angiography, including the diagnostic accuracy of CT
coronary angiography for the exclusion or detection of
significant CAD with coronary artery stenoses that may
require angioplastic intervention, as well as potentially
valuable information on the coronary artery vessel wall. In
the second section, the potential of CT for imaging of
myocardial viability and perfusion will be highlighted. In
the third and final part, the range of applications of cardiac
MRI in CAD patients will be outlined. Not all the imaging
methods described in this review are already being used in
the daily clinical work-up of patients with CAD, but they
are being used more and more every day. Therefore, their
correct clinical indication and clinical value need to be
discussed.
